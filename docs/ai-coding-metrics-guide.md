# AI Coding Metrics Guide
## Measuring Developer Productivity in the Age of AI-Assisted Development

### Executive Summary

Traditional coding metrics (lines of code, commits, PRs) fail to capture the reality of AI-assisted development. When developers use tools like Claude Code, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot, the nature of work fundamentally shifts from *writing* code to *directing* AI and *validating* outputs. This guide proposes new metrics and implementation strategies for measuring true productivity in AI-assisted development.

---

## The Problem with Current Metrics

### Traditional Metrics Don't Apply
- **Lines of Code**: AI can generate 1000+ lines in minutes - meaningless as productivity measure
- **Commits/PRs**: Batch sizes change dramatically with AI assistance
- **Time Spent**: A 5-minute AI session might accomplish what took hours manually

### What We're Actually Measuring Now
- AI's typing speed (always ~100% "productive")
- Raw output volume (not outcome quality)
- Token consumption (cost without context)

---

## What Managers Actually Need to Know

### Strategic Questions
1. **ROI**: Are we getting value from AI coding tools?
2. **Velocity**: Are we shipping features faster?
3. **Quality**: Is AI-generated code maintainable and bug-free?
4. **Team Efficiency**: Which developers use AI most effectively?
5. **Cost Management**: What's our cost per delivered feature?
6. **Risk Assessment**: Where is AI helping vs. creating technical debt?

### Tactical Questions
1. What types of tasks is AI best suited for?
2. Which developers need AI training/support?
3. What's our optimal AI tool budget allocation?
4. How much human review time does AI code require?

## Proposed Metrics Framework

### üéØ Outcome Metrics (Primary KPIs)

#### 1. Task Completion Rate
```
Completed Tasks / Attempted Tasks per Session
```
- Track via commit messages, PR descriptions, or explicit task marking
- Indicates effectiveness of AI usage

#### 2. Time-to-Resolution (TTR)
```
Time from Task Start ‚Üí Working Code in Production
```
- Compare AI-assisted vs. manual baseline
- Shows actual velocity improvement

#### 3. Feature Velocity Score
```
(Story Points Completed √ó Quality Score) / Hours Invested
```
- Weighted by complexity and quality
- Normalizes for task difficulty

#### 4. Cost per Business Value
```
Total AI Costs / (Features Shipped √ó Impact Score)
```
- Ties spending directly to business outcomes
- Helps justify AI tool investments

### üìä Process Metrics (Operational)

#### 5. Iteration Efficiency
```
1 / (Number of Prompt Iterations to Solution)
```
- Lower iterations = better prompt engineering
- Identifies training opportunities

#### 6. Human Leverage Ratio
```
Estimated Manual Hours / Actual Hours with AI
```
- Shows time multiplication factor
- Helps estimate ROI

#### 7. Review Overhead
```
Time Reviewing AI Code / Time Generating AI Code
```
- Indicates code quality and trust level
- Should decrease as teams mature

#### 8. Rework Rate
```
Lines Changed Post-Generation / Total Lines Generated
```
- Quality indicator
- High rework suggests poor prompting or inappropriate use cases

### üîß Quality Metrics (Automated Assessment)

#### 9. Code Quality Score
Automated analysis covering:
- Complexity (cyclomatic, cognitive)
- Maintainability index
- Test coverage delta
- Security vulnerabilities introduced
- Performance implications

#### 10. Pattern Compliance
```
Code Following Team Standards / Total Code Generated
```
- Naming conventions
- Architecture patterns
- Error handling standards
- Documentation completeness

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Modify Session Tracking**
   - Add task description field (required)
   - Add expected outcome field
   - Add complexity estimation (1-5 scale)
   - Track iteration count within sessions

2. **Outcome Tracking**
   - Add "task completed" boolean
   - Link sessions to tickets/issues
   - Track time from session to deployment

### Phase 2: Process Metrics (Weeks 3-4)
1. **Session Metadata**
   - Prompt iteration counter
   - Review time tracking
   - Rework tracking (edits to AI code)
   - Manual time estimate field

2. **Cost Attribution**
   - Link costs to specific features/projects
   - Add business value scoring
   - Calculate per-feature costs

### Phase 3: Quality Integration (Weeks 5-8)
1. **Automated Code Analysis**
   ```javascript
   // Example: Claude Code custom command
   async function analyzeCodeQuality(files) {
     return {
       complexity: calculateComplexity(files),
       maintainability: assessMaintainability(files),
       security: runSecurityScan(files),
       performance: analyzePerformance(files),
       standards: checkCodeStandards(files)
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Quality Scoring Pipeline**
   - Pre-commit quality checks
   - Post-generation analysis
   - Trend tracking over time

### Phase 4: Advanced Analytics (Weeks 9-12)
1. **Predictive Metrics**
   - Estimate task completion probability
   - Predict review time needed
   - Forecast monthly AI costs

2. **Team Intelligence**
   - Developer skill profiling
   - Best practices extraction
   - Automated prompt improvement suggestions

## Data Collection Strategies

### Automatic Collection
- **Git Integration**: Parse commit messages for task completion
- **IDE Plugins**: Track human review/edit time
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Measure deployment velocity
- **Code Analysis**: Run quality checks automatically

### Semi-Automated Collection
- **Session Start Prompt**: "What task are you working on? (1-5 complexity)"
- **Session End Prompt**: "Was the task completed? Time saved estimate?"
- **PR Templates**: Include AI-assistance metadata

### Manual Collection (Minimal)
- Weekly team surveys (5 min)
- Sprint retrospective metrics
- Feature impact scoring
